## Key Features

- **Humanity's Future is in your hands!** ðŸš€ #HUMANITY
- **Player-controlled spaceship** with directional movement and shooting abilities.
- **Alien Enemy Spaceship and Projectiles**: The alien enemy relentlessly attacks the player's spaceship.
- **Dynamic Health System**:
  - The player's spaceship leaves a trail that represents health:
    - **Yellow Trail**: Full health.
    - **Red Trail**: Low health or negative score.
- **Gameplay Mechanics**:
  - If the player's spaceship is hit by the alien's projectile:
    - The spaceship relocates to a random position.
    - The trail turns red to indicate low health.
  - If the player's spaceship is hit while health is low (red trail):
    - The player dies, and the game ends.
  - To restore full health:
    - Shoot the enemy alien once, and the trail will turn back to yellow, representing successful recovery.
  - If the alien enemy is hit:
    - It relocates to a random position and resumes its attack.
